# Hand-Gesture-Recognition

# 🖐️ Hand Gesture Recognition  🤖  

Welcome to the **Hand Gesture Recognition** project! This system utilizes **OpenCV, MediaPipe, and TensorFlow** to detect and classify hand gestures in real-time using a webcam.  


---

## 🚀 Features  
✔️ **Real-time Hand Tracking** using MediaPipe  
✔️ **Deep Learning-Based Gesture Classification** with a trained model  
✔️ **Seamless Webcam Integration** for gesture recognition  
✔️ **User-Friendly Output Display** with live gesture predictions

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python** 🐍  
- **OpenCV** 🎥  
- **MediaPipe** ✋  
- **TensorFlow/Keras** 🧠  

---

## 🎯 How It Works  
1. **Capture Hand Landmarks** 📷 using **MediaPipe**  
2. **Process and Predict** 🤔 gestures with a **trained deep learning model**  
3. **Display Results** 🎨 in real-time using OpenCV

## 🏁 Getting Started  

### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies  
```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe tensorflow numpy

### 2️⃣ Run the Application
```bash
python hand_gesture_detection.py

### 3️⃣ Interact with the Model
👋 Show different hand gestures and see them classified in real-time!
