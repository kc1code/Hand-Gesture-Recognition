# Hand-Gesture-Recognition

# 🖐️ Hand Gesture Recognition with AI 🤖  

Welcome to the **Hand Gesture Recognition** project! This AI-powered system utilizes **OpenCV, MediaPipe, and TensorFlow** to detect and classify hand gestures in real-time using a webcam. Whether you want to control applications touch-free, develop assistive technologies, or explore gesture-based interaction, this project serves as an excellent foundation for innovative solutions.
